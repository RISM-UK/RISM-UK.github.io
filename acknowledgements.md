## Manuscript sources  

An initial project to document music manuscripts in UK libraries took place in the 1960s. The information was captured in a card catalogue, and this catalogue (converted to electronic form) underpins the current online catalogue.  Mr Richard Andrewes, formerly Head of Music at Cambridge University Library, was a key figure in this first cataloguing project.
The catalogue data was enhanced with music incipits, and new catalogue records for anonymous works were created, during the UK RISM Music Manuscripts Project, a collaboration between Royal Holloway, University of London, the British Library and the RISM (UK) Trust.  

## Printed sources  

The online catalogue records for single-composer printed editions are derived from the printed Series A RISM volumes.  

In 2011, Royal Holloway and the British Library undertook Early Music Online, a project to digitise and create detailed catalogue records for 326 anthologies printed in the 16th-century (between them containing over 12,000 works). The catalogue records are not currently available via the RISM platform, but can be retrieved from the [British Library catalogue](http://explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?fn=search&ct=search&initialSearch=true&mode=Basic&tab=local_tab&indx=1&dum=true&srt=rank&vid=BLVU1&frbg=&tb=t&vl%28freeText0%29=dar_287&scp.scps=scope%3A%28BLCONTENT%29&vl%282084770704UI0%29=any&vl%282084770704UI0%29=title&vl%282084770704UI0%29=any), or browsed via the [Royal Holloway Digital Repository](https://repository.royalholloway.ac.uk/hierarchy.do?topic=52facdbd-19ce-2b92-dbd5-434289d29e8b&page=1). The digitised scores are also available in both locations.
