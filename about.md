# About us  

Since 1984, work to identify printed and manuscript musical sources in UK libraries and include them in the central RISM database has been co-ordinated by the RISM (UK) Trust.  

In 2001, the Trust embarked on a partnership with the British Library and Royal Holloway, University of London, which in 2007 delivered the UK RISM Music Manuscripts catalogue (1600-1800). The data about all of these manuscripts was later incorporated into the international RISM database, which can be searched at www.rism.info.  

In 2020, a new search interface for RISM UK was provided by the Swiss RISM branch.  This enables users to search for all sources from libraries in Britain listed in the international RISM database.
