# About us  

Since 1984, work to identify printed and manuscript musical sources in UK libraries and include them in the central RISM database has been co-ordinated by the RISM (UK) Trust.  

In 2001, the Trust embarked on a partnership with the British Library and Royal Holloway University of London, which in 2007 delivered the UK RISM Music Manuscripts catalogue.  The data about all of these manuscripts was subsequently included in the international RISM database at www.rism.info.
