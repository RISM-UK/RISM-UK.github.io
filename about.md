# About us  

In Britain, work to identify sources and include them in the central RISM database is co-ordinated by the RISM (UK) Trust.  

Since 2001, the Trust has worked in partnership with the British Library and Royal Holloway University of London on a series of projects to document musical sources held in libraries across England, Scotland and Wales.
