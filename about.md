# About RISM in the UK  

The first large-scale survey of printed music in UK libraries was *The British Union-Catalogue of Early Music Printed Before the Year 1801. A Record of the Holdings of over One Hundred Libraries Throughout the British Isles*, edited by Edith B. Schnapper (1957). Much of the data from this catalogue was later included in the printed RISM catalogues, and is now available in the central RISM Online Catalogue of Musical Sources. 

An initial project to document music manuscripts in UK libraries took place in the 1960s. The information collected in the 1960s was recorded in a card catalogue and supplemented with further data in the 1980s, again in paper form.

Since 1984, work to identify printed and manuscript musical sources in UK libraries and archives has been co-ordinated by the RISM (UK) Trust.  

In 2001, the RISM (UK) Trust embarked on the RISM UK Music Manuscripts Project in partnership with the British Library and Royal Holloway, University of London. This involved the keying of the data from cards and slips created from the 1960s onwards, the enhancement of these records with musical incipits, and the cataloguing of anonymous works, which had not been included in the earlier projects. All of the data from this project is now searchable in the central Online Catalogue of Musical Sources.  Work to document manuscript sources is the UK is by no means complete, and funding is being sought to continue this work.

In 2011, Royal Holloway and the British Library undertook Early Music Online, a project to digitise and create detailed catalogue records for 326 anthologies printed in the 16th-century (between them containing over 12,000 works). The catalogue records are not currently available via the RISM platform, but can be retrieved from the [British Library catalogue](http://explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?fn=search&ct=search&initialSearch=true&mode=Basic&tab=local_tab&indx=1&dum=true&srt=rank&vid=BLVU1&frbg=&tb=t&vl%28freeText0%29=dar_287&scp.scps=scope%3A%28BLCONTENT%29&vl%282084770704UI0%29=any&vl%282084770704UI0%29=title&vl%282084770704UI0%29=any), or browsed via the [Royal Holloway Digital Repository](https://repository.royalholloway.ac.uk/hierarchy.do?topic=52facdbd-19ce-2b92-dbd5-434289d29e8b&page=1). The digitised scores are also available in both locations.
