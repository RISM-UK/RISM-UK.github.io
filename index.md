# Welcome to the RISM UK website  

RÃ©pertoire International des Sources Musicales (RISM) is an international non-profit venture which aims to document surviving musical sources worldwide.  Its focus is on material dating from before 1850.  

The sources documented for RISM include music manuscripts and printed music, writings on music and libretti. These materials are preserved in libraries, archives, religious foundations, schools and private collections across the world.  

Also known as the International Inventory of Musical Sources, RISM is the product of years of research and cataloguing in more than 30 countries - work that is still ongoing.

**[Search the central Online Catalogue of Musical Sources on the international RISM website](http://www.rism.info/home.html)**  

Note: The central Online Catalogue includes all catalogue records for pre-1800 manuscript music in UK libraries that have been created up till now. Coverage is not yet comprehensive, however.  It also contains records for most pre-1800 printed music identified to date. Again, coverage is not comprehensive. 

Coming soon: a new search portal for sources in the UK!
