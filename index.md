# Welcome to the website of RISM in the UK  

RÃ©pertoire International des Sources Musicales (RISM) is an international venture which aims to document surviving musical sources worldwide. Also known as the International Inventory of Musical Sources, it is the result of decades of research and cataloguing in more than 30 countries.  The sources documented by RISM include music manuscripts and printed music, writings on music and libretti. These materials are preserved in libraries, archives, religious foundations, schools and private collections across the world.  

In the UK, work to identify and document printed and manuscript sources from before 1800 is overseen by the RISM (UK) Trust. 

In 2001, a six-year partnership between the British Library and Royal Holloway University of London, funded by the AHRC, resulted in the documentation of thousands of 17th- and 18th-century music manuscripts held in UK libraries.
