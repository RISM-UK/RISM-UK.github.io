RÃ©pertoire International des Sources Musicales (RISM), also known as the International Inventory of Musical Sources, is an international venture which aims to document surviving musical sources worldwide.   
These sources include manuscripts and printed music, writings on music and libretti housed in libraries, archives, monasteries, schools and private collections across the world.  

The RISM (UK) Trust oversees work to document printed and manuscript musical sources in Britain and add the data to the international RISM database at www.rism.info
