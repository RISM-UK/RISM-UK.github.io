RÃ©pertoire International des Sources Musicales (RISM) is an international venture which aims to document surviving musical sources worldwide. Also known as the International Inventory of Musical Sources, it is the result of decades of research and cataloguing in more than 30 countries.  Much of the data can now be searched centrally via the international RISM database at www.rism.info  

The sources documented by RISM include music manuscripts and printed music, writings on music and libretti. They are preserved in libraries, archives, monasteries, schools and private collections across the world.  

The RISM (UK) Trust oversees the work to document printed and manuscript musical sources in Britain.
