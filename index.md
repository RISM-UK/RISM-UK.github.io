# Welcome to the RISM UK website  

RISM (RÃ©pertoire International des Sources Musicales) is an international collaborative programme which aims to document all pre-1850 musical sources surviving in libraries and archives worldwide. These sources include printed and manuscript music, writings on music and libretti.

Through its online and printed publications, RISM brings together the results of research and cataloguing in more than 30 countries including the UK - work that is still ongoing.  In the UK, work is co-ordinated by the RISM (UK) Trust.

## Note on coverage of material held in UK libraries  

The international RISM Catalog of Musical Sources includes all catalogue records for pre-1800 manuscript music in UK libraries that have been created up till now. Cataloguing of UK collections is not yet complete, however. The international RISM Catalog also contains data on most single-composer pre-1800 printed editions identified in UK libraries. It does not include detailed descriptions of music in printed anthologies. See [About RISM in the UK](/about) for information on anthologies catalogued for the Early Music Online project.  

The recently launched RISM UK Catalogue is a subset of the international RISM database, containing data on printed and manuscript music held in British* libraries and archives. It contains the same data on sources in Britain as is found in the international database, but with a different search interface.

*Content from Northern Ireland is now within the scope of [RISM Ireland](http://www.rism-ie.org/), and should be searched for in the international database, or via RISM Ireland's own platform.
