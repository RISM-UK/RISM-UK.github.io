# Welcome to the RISM UK website  

RÃ©pertoire International des Sources Musicales (RISM) is an international non-profit venture which aims to document surviving musical sources worldwide.  Its focus is on material dating from before 1850.  

The sources documented for RISM include music manuscripts and printed music, writings on music and libretti. These materials are preserved in libraries, archives, religious foundations, schools and private collections across the world.  

Also known as the International Inventory of Musical Sources, RISM is the product of years of research and cataloguing in more than 30 countries - work that is still ongoing.

The central Online Catalogue of Musical Sources brings together much of this data into a single searchable database.

Note on coverage of material in UK libraries:  

The central Online Catalogue includes all catalogue records for pre-1800 manuscript music in UK libraries that have been created up till now. Cataloguing of UK collections is not yet complete, however.  The central Online Catalogue also contains data on most single-composer pre-1800 printed editions identified in UK libraries. It does not include detailed descriptions of music in printed anthologies. See [Projects](/projects) for information on anthologies catalogued for the Early Music Online project. 

Coming soon: a new search platform for sources in the UK!
